# gpt3-mock-api

I don't currently have access to the gpt3 API, however I was interested in exploring the request/response structure and wanted to run the gpt3-experiments.

This mock server has been written by reverse engineering the minimal request/response protocol required to run the gpt3-experiments with the default config.

Responses for temperature zero requests are deterministic - non-zero temperature requests return random results.

The mock server does not require headers to be set, and I'm assuming that responses only contain a subset of the actual response structure returned from the API.

I'd love an invite to be able to run these experiments for real.

To run the experiments against this mock server, change the urls in the openai_api.py file, replacing 'https' with 'http' and replacing 'api.openai.com' with 'localhost:8080'. 

The mock server can be run via the following command from this directory:


```
$ mvn spring-boot:run
